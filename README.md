I have used DenverCoder1's tutorial on YouTube as a starting point to create my first project outside of a formal course. A slight refactor has been made to it so that high/low temperatures also display.

Data comes from the OpenWeatherMap API, and this app is intended to initially show the weather in the location of your device using reverse geolocation from the OpenCage API. The search box is there for finding out the weather in locations besides the one that is detected initially. Background images are from Unsplash's random search term functionality, which is linked to the CSS file.

# What I Learned
 - How to use external APIs for the first time
 - How to extract information from a JSON data structure
 - Asynchronous JavaScript (including Promises and error handling)

# Get Started
This can be run locally on VSCode in the project directory with the Live Server extension as there are no dependancies.
